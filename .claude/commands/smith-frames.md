# Frame Smith (Alias for Style Engine)

**This command is an alias for `/style-engine`.** Run `/style-engine` instead.

All functionality has been consolidated in the `/style-engine` command, reflecting the "style engine" concept (Reimer & Peter) — GenAI as a tool that renders the same empirical reality through multiple theoretical styles.
