# Theory-Building vs Theory-Testing Language Guide

**Purpose**: This guide helps researchers use language appropriate for their paper's genre. It is NOT a hard constraint—some papers legitimately test hypotheses. Use this when your paper is **building** theory from data, not testing pre-specified hypotheses.

---

## When to Use This Guide

**Use this guide when:**
- Your paper develops new theory from empirical patterns
- You're doing inductive or abductive research
- You're proposing mechanisms, frameworks, or typologies
- Your contribution is "here's a new way to think about X"

**Don't use this guide when:**
- You have pre-registered hypotheses
- You're running a deductive test of existing theory
- Your contribution is "Theory X is supported/refuted"
- The journal explicitly expects hypothesis testing

**A single paper can't do both.** If you're discovering patterns and building theory, you can't also claim to be testing it. The intellectual work is different.

## The Core Distinction

| Theory-Building | Theory-Testing |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Discovers patterns in data | Tests predictions against data |
| Proposes mechanisms | Validates mechanisms |
| "The data suggest..." | "The data confirm/support..." |
| "We find a pattern consistent with..." | "We find support for Hypothesis 1" |
| Contribution: new framework | Contribution: validated/refuted hypothesis |

## Language Rubric

### RED FLAGS: Language that implies hypothesis testing

| Category | Problematic Terms | Why It's Wrong | Theory-Building Alternative |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Testing verbs** | validate, test, confirm, verify, prove, support (as in "supports the hypothesis") | Implies prior hypothesis being tested against data | "is consistent with," "aligns with," "suggests," "the pattern indicates" |
| **Hypothesis language** | hypothesis, hypothesize, predict (when stating what we expect to find), proposition (formal numbered) | Theory-building discovers patterns, doesn't test predictions | "expected pattern," "we anticipate," "the theory suggests we should observe" |
| **Statistical inference framing** | significant (as in statistically significant confirming a hypothesis), reject/fail to reject, p-value interpretation as confirmation | Implies NHST framework for testing | Describe effect sizes, patterns, distributions; focus on practical significance |
| **Causal confirmation** | demonstrates that, establishes that, proves that, confirms that | Implies definitive causal test | "is consistent with the interpretation that," "suggests," "indicates" |
| **Deductive structure** | as predicted, consistent with our prediction, supports our hypothesis | Implies hypothetico-deductive logic | "as the theory would suggest," "consistent with the mechanism we propose" |

### YELLOW FLAGS: Context-dependent (sometimes OK)

| Term | When It's OK | When It's NOT OK |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **"validate"** | "Qualitative data validate that the categories are meaningful to informants" (member checking) | "The data validate the hypothesis" |
| **"test"** | "Robustness tests" (sensitivity analysis), "test whether pooling masks heterogeneity" (exploratory) | "We test the hypothesis that..." |
| **"support"** | "These accounts support the interpretation that..." (building argument) | "The data support Hypothesis 1" |
| **"predict"** | "The theory predicts that we should observe..." (deriving implications) | "We predicted and then tested..." |
| **"significant"** | "A significant departure from prior work" (important) | "Statistically significant at p < .05" (as confirmation) |
| **"confirm"** | "Interviews confirm that managers think this way" (triangulation) | "Results confirm the hypothesis" |

### GREEN FLAGS: Theory-building language

| Category | Preferred Terms |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Discovery verbs** | reveal, uncover, identify, document, observe, find, discover |
| **Pattern language** | pattern, theme, mechanism, process, dynamic |
| **Tentative framing** | suggests, indicates, is consistent with, may, appears to |
| **Building language** | propose, develop, advance, extend, elaborate, refine |
| **Inductive structure** | "the data reveal," "we observe," "informants described," "the pattern suggests" |

### STRUCTURAL RED FLAGS

1. **Numbered hypotheses** (H1, H2, H3) - classic deductive structure
2. **Propositions with testable predictions** - theory-building can have propositions but they're generative, not testable
3. **"Methods → Results → Discussion" framing** that reads as "predict → test → interpret"
4. **Tables with "Hypothesis" and "Supported/Not Supported" columns**

### ACCEPTABLE THEORY-BUILDING STRUCTURE

- "Expected Patterns" instead of "Hypotheses"
- "Findings" instead of "Results" (subtle but signals discovery)
- Propositions framed as "if the theory is correct, we should observe..." rather than "we predict..."
- Discussion framed as "extending" and "refining" theory, not "confirming" it

## Examples of Fixes

| Before (Theory-Testing) | After (Theory-Building) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| "We validated this framework by testing whether predictions aligned with data" | "We checked whether the framework's expectations aligned with observed patterns" |
| "The data confirm that the mechanism operates" | "The data are consistent with the proposed mechanism" |
| "Statistical tests confirm the reliability" | "Statistical tests indicate the reliability" |
| "These results support our hypothesis" | "These patterns are consistent with the interpretation" |
| "Lead-lag tests confirm that X doesn't predict Y" | "Lead-lag analyses suggest that X doesn't predict Y" |

## Invoking This Style

When working on a theory-building paper, tell Claude:

> "This is a theory-building paper. Use the theory-building language style from THEORY_BUILDING_STYLE.md. Avoid hypothesis-testing language like 'validate,' 'confirm,' 'test' (except for robustness checks), and 'support the hypothesis.' Use 'suggests,' 'indicates,' 'is consistent with,' and 'the pattern reveals' instead."

Or during a scrub:

> "Run a theory-building language scrub on this manuscript. Flag any hypothesis-testing language per THEORY_BUILDING_STYLE.md."

## Note on Zuckerman's Framework

This guide complements Ezra Zuckerman's "Tips for Article-Writers." Zuckerman's framework provides the fundamental moves for writing a compelling paper:

1. **The puzzle** - a real-world phenomenon that existing theory can't explain
2. **Build up and save the null** - make the conventional explanation compelling before showing why it fails
3. **The contribution** - your proposed explanation for the puzzle

These moves work for BOTH theory-building and theory-testing papers. The difference is:
- **Theory-testing**: "Theory X predicts Y. We test this. The data support/refute it."
- **Theory-building**: "Theory X predicts Y. The data show NOT-Y for some cases. We propose Z as an explanation."

The language guide here addresses genre, not strategy. Zuckerman's framework tells you what moves to make; this guide tells you what language to use when making those moves in a theory-building paper.
