# Journal Fit Analysis and Potential Reviewers

**November 2025**

This document analyzes which journal (Administrative Science Quarterly or Management Science) is best suited for each of the three papers, and suggests potential editors and reviewers.

---

## Paper 1: "Option Cultivation" (Worker responses to uncertain automation)

### Recommended: Administrative Science Quarterly (ASQ)

**Why ASQ is ideal:**
- **Beth Bechky** (incoming editor) is an ethnographer who studies how workers manage technological change—this is *exactly* her research focus. Her own work on ["DNA envy" in forensic science](https://asqblog.com/2019/11/22/bechky-2019-evaluative-spillovers-from-technological-change-the-effects-of-dna-envy-on-occupational-practices-in-forensic-science/) examines how technology changes occupational practices.
- The paper uses mixed methods (quantitative exit records + 351 interviews/718 hours observation)—ASQ welcomes this approach
- Theory-building contribution (extending real options theory to show workers *cultivate* rather than just *hold* options)
- Inductive, qualitative-grounded theorizing aligns with ASQ's tradition

**Potential editors/reviewers at ASQ:**
- **Beth Bechky** (editor) - automation/technology + ethnography of work ([UC Davis profile](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/faculty/beth-bechky))
- **Siobhan O'Mahony** (associate editor, BU) - studies how people organize around technological change ([BU Questrom profile](https://www.bu.edu/questrom/profiles/siobhan-omahony/))
- **Erin Reid** (associate editor, McMaster) - work-family dynamics, contingent/gig workers ([McMaster profile](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/reidem))
- **Greta Hsu** (associate editor, UC Davis) - categories and classification

**External reviewer suggestions:**
- **Amy Wrzesniewski** (Yale) - work orientation, job crafting ([Yale SOM profile](https://som.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/amy-wrzesniewski))
- **Michel Anteby** (BU) - occupational identity and dirty work

## Paper 2: "Learning to Automate" (Multi-site exploration/exploitation)

### Recommended: Management Science

**Why Management Science is ideal:**
- Anchored on [March's exploration/exploitation framework](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2.1.71)—canonical for Management Science
- Heavy quantitative emphasis with extensive robustness checks (9 threshold alternatives, pre-trends, placebo tests)
- Operations/organizational learning intersection
- Multi-site/facility-level analysis typical of Management Science empirical work

**Potential department/editors at Management Science:**
- **Organizations Department** - expanded to include computational social science methods
- **Behavioral Operations** - if framing emphasizes operational learning
- **Strategy** - Alfonso Gambardella (Bocconi), Maria Guadalupe (INSEAD)

**External reviewer suggestions:**
- **Linda Argote** (Carnegie Mellon) - organizational learning, knowledge transfer
- **Melissa Valentine** (Stanford) - teams, technology, coordination
- **Damon Phillips** (Columbia) - categories, organizational identity

## Paper 3: "When Misfit Motivates" (Work orientation + P-E fit)

### Either journal could work, but lean ASQ

**Why ASQ:**
- Extends person-environment fit theory by adding work orientation as moderator—theory-building contribution
- Qualitative evidence is central to revealing the three orientation types
- Work orientation literature (Wrzesniewski) is heavily cited in org behavior
- Beth Bechky's interest in workers' responses to organizational systems

**Why Management Science could also work:**
- Behavioral Economics and Decision Analysis department
- Strong quantitative component (55K worker-month observations)
- Incentive system design angle could appeal to behavioral operations

**Potential ASQ editors/reviewers:**
- **Erin Reid** (associate editor) - contingent workers, gig work, work-family ([personal site](https://www.proferinreid.com/))
- **Aleksandra Kacperczyk** (associate editor, LBS) - career transitions, entrepreneurship within firms ([publications](https://www.olenkak.com/publications))
- **Emily Bianchi** (associate editor, Emory) - careers, economic conditions

**External reviewer suggestions:**
- **Amy Wrzesniewski** (Yale) - the foundational work orientation scholar ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PkY8LbEAAAAJ&hl=en))
- **Amy Kristof-Brown** (Iowa) - 30 years studying person-organization fit
- **Brianna Caza** (UNC Greensboro) - gig work, work identity (co-authored with Erin Reid on [gig work challenges](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00187267211030098))

## Strategic Notes

**Paper 1 → ASQ**: Beth Bechky's research interests align remarkably well—she literally studies "how workers... manage the challenges of technological change" using ethnographic methods. Your paper does exactly this. Her recent work includes a [2025 ASQ essay on AI and scholarly publishing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00018392241304403) and she was named a [Microsoft Research AI & Society Fellow for 2024](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/blog/we-are-gsm-video-meet-professor-beth-bechky) to study how technology shapes creative work.

**Paper 2 → Management Science**: The Organizations department has [expanded its coverage](https://pubsonline.informs.org/page/mnsc/editorial-statement) to include computational social science methods. The exploration/exploitation framing from March (1991) is foundational for this journal.

**Paper 3 → ASQ (with Management Science backup)**: Erin Reid's research on [gig workers and contingent employment](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erin-Reid-10) makes her an ideal associate editor for this paper. The theory-building contribution (orientation moderates P-E fit predictions) fits ASQ's emphasis.
