# Prerequisites: What You Need Before Using Theory-Forge

**Theory-forge assumes you already have qualitative methods training.**

This is an acceleration tool for experienced researchers, not a replacement for methodological foundations.

---

## Required Background

Before using theory-forge, you should have:

### 1. Coded at least one dataset by hand

You need to know what it feels like to:
- Read through transcripts multiple times
- Develop codes iteratively
- Struggle with ambiguous passages
- Notice patterns emerging (and false patterns fading)
- Experience the frustration of recoding when your framing shifts

If you haven't done this, theory-forge will produce outputs you can't evaluate. You won't know if the AI is surfacing genuine patterns or confirming your biases.

### 2. Written at least one qualitative methods section

You should understand:
- How to describe your data (sources, sampling, time period)
- How to explain your analytical approach
- What "saturation" means and when you've reached it
- How to handle disconfirming evidence
- The difference between description and interpretation

### 3. Read extensively in your theoretical area

You need:
- Familiarity with 2-3 bodies of literature you might draw on
- A sense of what constitutes a "contribution" in your field
- Understanding of which journals publish which kinds of work
- Ability to recognize when a finding violates established theory

### 4. Experienced peer review (ideally both sides)

You should know:
- What reviewers look for
- Common objections to qualitative work
- How to respond to "alternative explanation" concerns
- Why claims need evidence (and what counts as evidence)

## What Theory-Forge Does NOT Teach

- How to design a qualitative study
- How to conduct interviews
- How to take field notes
- How to develop theoretical sensitivity
- How to know when you're done collecting data
- How to write for a specific journal's style

These are skills developed through coursework, apprenticeship, and practice. Theory-forge assumes you have them.

## The Risk of Skipping Prerequisites

If you use theory-forge without the background above:

| What Happens | Why It's a Problem |
|--------------|-------------------|
| AI produces themes | You can't tell if they're real patterns or noise |
| AI suggests theories | You can't evaluate fit to your data |
| AI generates framings | You can't judge which is defensible |
| AI drafts paper | You can't tell if claims outrun evidence |

The result: papers that look polished but lack substance. Reviewers will catch this. Your reputation suffers.

## Recommended Preparation

### For PhD Students

1. **Complete your methods courses first** — especially qualitative methods
2. **Code one dataset manually** — before touching theory-forge
3. **Write one paper the traditional way** — understand the full process
4. **Then use theory-forge** — with your advisor reviewing outputs

### For Faculty Learning New Methods

1. **Take a qual methods workshop** — many professional associations offer these
2. **Partner with an experienced qualitative researcher** — for your first project
3. **Use theory-forge as a second opinion** — not a replacement for judgment

## When Theory-Forge Adds Value

The tool shines when you:
- Have rich data you know well
- Have theoretical intuition but need to test framings
- Want to ensure you haven't missed disconfirming evidence
- Need to accelerate the iteration cycle (not skip it)
- Want systematic documentation for methods sections

The tool fails when you:
- Don't know your data
- Can't evaluate AI suggestions
- Want to skip the hard thinking
- Hope AI will compensate for missing skills

## A Note on "Acceleration"

Theory-forge can turn a 6-month analysis into 6 weeks—**for someone who could do it in 6 months manually**.

It cannot turn someone who couldn't do the analysis into someone who can. The skills remain prerequisite. The tool just makes skilled work faster.
