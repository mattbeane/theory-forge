# "Microwave" Uses of AI in Qualitative Research

## The Metaphor

When microwaves first arrived, people thought they'd replace ovens. Turns out microwaves are just really good at heating things. That's what we use them for now. The only button anyone uses is "add 30 seconds."

Same logic applies to AI in qualitative research: there are small, bounded uses that don't require a full pipeline. Just heat this one thing.

## Out of Scope for Theory-Forge

Theory-Forge is an **integrated framework**—a dynamically reconfigurable assembly line for turning dormant research data into submittable papers. It's not a collection of one-off utilities.

The following "microwave" uses are **explicitly out of scope**:

| Use Case | Why Out of Scope |
|----------|------------------|
| Summarize a single transcript | Any user can prompt this directly |
| Extract themes from one document | Basic prompting; no framework needed |
| Compare two documents | Simple prompt; doesn't need state management |
| Find quotes about a topic | Control-F with context; trivial to prompt |
| Brainstorm interview questions | General LLM use; not research pipeline |
| Clean up transcription errors | Utility task; not theory-building |

## Why These Don't Belong in Theory-Forge

1. **No state required** — These don't need project structure, gates, or tracking
2. **No quality enforcement** — Theory-Forge's value is in the hard gates; one-off tasks bypass that
3. **Trivial to do directly** — Any LLM can do these with a simple prompt
4. **Scope creep risk** — Adding utilities dilutes the framework's focus

## If You Want Microwave Tools

Just prompt Claude/GPT directly:

```
"Summarize this interview transcript in 1 paragraph, then list 3-5 key themes with one supporting quote each."
```

```
"Find all quotes in this document related to [topic]. Include line numbers and surrounding context."
```

```
"Compare these two interviews. What's similar? What's different? Where do they contradict each other?"
```

No framework required. No installation. Just prompt.

## What Theory-Forge IS For

Theory-Forge is for the **full journey from data to paper**:

- Systematic pattern discovery with robustness checking
- Theory identification and sensitizing literature matching
- Mechanism evidence extraction with consensus validation
- Framing generation and Zuckerman criteria evaluation
- Claim verification with audit trail
- Journal-ready manuscript drafting

If you need the assembly line, use Theory-Forge.
If you just need to heat up leftovers, prompt an LLM directly.
