## Theory Section Depth Check

Theory sections in ASQ and Organization Science require **deep engagement**, not just citation strings. A thin theory section is a common desk rejection trigger.

### Word Count Minimums

| Journal | Theory Section Minimum | Red Flag |
|---------|----------------------|----------|
| **ASQ** | 1,500-2,500 words | < 1,000 words |
| **Organization Science** | 1,500-2,500 words | < 1,000 words |
| **AMJ** | 2,000-3,000 words (includes hypotheses) | < 1,500 words |
| **Management Science** | 1,500-2,500 words (includes hypotheses) | < 1,200 words |

### Deep Engagement Indicators

A theory section demonstrates deep engagement when it:

1. **Unpacks mechanisms, not just outcomes**
   - ❌ "Prior work shows X leads to Y (Author, Year)"
   - ✅ "Author (Year) argues that X leads to Y through mechanism Z, because [explanation of why Z matters]"

2. **Explicitly defines novel constructs before findings**
   - If you introduce a new term (e.g., "developmental uncertainty"), define it in theory
   - State what it is, what it's not, and why existing terms don't capture it

3. **Builds tension or puzzle**
   - Theory should create expectation that findings will either confirm, extend, or challenge
   - Reader should understand the theoretical stakes before seeing data

4. **Cites foundational works substantively**
   - Key theorists (Thompson, Galbraith, Perrow for contingency; Abbott for professions; etc.) should be engaged, not just name-dropped
   - ❌ Citation string: "(Thompson, 1967; Galbraith, 1973; Burns & Stalker, 1961)"
   - ✅ Substantive engagement: "Thompson (1967) distinguishes three forms of interdependence... Galbraith (1973) extends this by arguing..."

5. **States null expectations explicitly**
   - What would standard theory predict? Why might your case be different?
   - This creates the puzzle your paper resolves

### Comparison to Exemplars

When assessing theory section depth, compare against published exemplars:

| Paper | Theory Words | Key Feature |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Barley (1990) ASQ | ~2,500 | Deep engagement with contingency theory, explicit mechanisms |
| Bernstein (2012) ASQ | ~2,000 | Builds theoretical tension, defines "transparency trap" |
| Leonardi (2011) OrgSci | ~1,800 | Unpacks affordance theory, defines "imbrication" |
| Bailey et al. (2012) AMJ | ~2,200 | Reviews emotion regulation literature systematically |

### Quick Diagnostic

Run this check before submission:

1. **Word count**: Is theory section ≥ 1,500 words? If not, likely too thin.

2. **Citation depth**: For your 5 most important theoretical citations, do you engage with them for 2+ sentences each? If most appear only in citation strings, engagement is shallow.

3. **Novel construct definition**: If you introduce a new term, is it explicitly defined before findings? Can a reader explain what it means without reading your findings?

4. **Mechanism preview**: Do you explain *why* effects occur, not just *that* they occur? (Note: For inductive papers, preview the *type* of mechanisms you'll explore, not the specific mechanisms you'll find.)

5. **Theoretical stakes**: After reading theory, does the reader know what's at stake? What would be surprising vs. expected?

### Recovery Strategies for Thin Theory

If your theory section is thin:

1. **Expand foundational citations**: Pick 2-3 key theorists and engage with their arguments substantively (2-3 sentences each)

2. **Add null expectation**: What would conventional theory predict? Why might your setting differ?

3. **Define terms explicitly**: If you use a novel term, give it a formal definition paragraph

4. **Unpack mechanisms**: For each theoretical claim, explain the causal pathway

5. **State boundary conditions**: Under what conditions does the theory apply? When might it not?

## Common Rejection Reasons (and How to Avoid Them)

### "Incremental contribution"
- **Fix**: Sharpen the theoretical puzzle; make clear what's surprising
- **Check**: Can you state what's new in one sentence?

### "Methods don't match claims"
- **Fix**: Align claims with what your data can actually show
- **Check**: Could a skeptic poke holes in your causal story?

### "Not engaging with the literature"
- **Fix**: More citations, deeper engagement with foundational works
- **Check**: Would experts in this area see their work cited?

### "Unclear theoretical mechanism"
- **Fix**: Be explicit about WHY your effect occurs
- **Check**: Could you draw a box-and-arrow diagram of your theory?

### "Too long / unfocused"
- **Fix**: Cut ruthlessly; one key point, not three
- **Check**: Does every paragraph advance the main argument?

## Word Count Tools

### For LaTeX files:
```bash
# Rough count (strips commands)
cat paper.tex | sed 's/\\[a-zA-Z]*{[^}]*}//g' | sed 's/\\[a-zA-Z]*//g' | wc -w

# More accurate: use texcount
texcount paper.tex
```

### For Word files:
- Use built-in word count (Review > Word Count)
- Exclude footnotes/endnotes if journal counts body only

### For Overleaf:
- Menu > Word Count (provides detailed breakdown)

## AI Disclosure and Data Availability

### AI Disclosure (Methods Section)

Place at end of analytical approach / data analysis subsection.

**For Qualitative/Mixed-Methods Papers:**
```
We used large language model assistants during manuscript preparation
and analysis. AI assistance supported literature search and synthesis,
exploratory data analysis, identification of patterns in qualitative
data, and prose drafting. The authors directed all analytical choices:
research design, data collection, selection of theoretical framing,
evaluation of alternative interpretations, and final claims. We verified
all citations, quotes, and empirical claims against primary sources.
The authors bear full responsibility for the accuracy and integrity
of this work.
```

**For Quantitative Papers:**
Add "model specification and variable operationalization" to author-directed work.

**For Conceptual Papers:**
Swap "coding and interpretation of qualitative data" for "argument construction and interpretation of cited work."

### Data Availability (When Data Is Protected)

```
Interview transcripts and [data type] remain protected under IRB protocol
and nondisclosure agreements; these data cannot be shared. To support
verification, we provide: (1) quote provenance metadata linking each
in-text quote to interview source and location; (2) a claim-evidence
registry documenting supporting and challenging evidence for each
substantive claim; and (3) aggregated quantitative summaries. These
materials are available upon request from the first author. Researchers
seeking to verify specific claims can arrange supervised access through
a data use agreement.
```
