## Common Rejection Reasons (and How to Avoid Them)

### "Incremental contribution"
- **Fix**: Sharpen the theoretical puzzle; make clear what's surprising
- **Check**: Can you state what's new in one sentence?

### "Methods don't match claims"
- **Fix**: Align claims with what your data can actually show
- **Check**: Could a skeptic poke holes in your causal story?

### "Not engaging with the literature"
- **Fix**: More citations, deeper engagement with foundational works
- **Check**: Would experts in this area see their work cited?

### "Unclear theoretical mechanism"
- **Fix**: Be explicit about WHY your effect occurs
- **Check**: Could you draw a box-and-arrow diagram of your theory?

### "Too long / unfocused"
- **Fix**: Cut ruthlessly; one key point, not three
- **Check**: Does every paragraph advance the main argument?

## Reference Formatting Quick Guide

### ASQ (APA Style as of 2025)
```
In-text: (Author, Year) or Author (Year)
Reference: Author, A. B. (Year). Title. Journal, Volume(Issue), pages.
```

### Management Science
```
In-text: Author (Year) or (Author Year)
Reference: Author AB (Year) Title. Journal Volume(Issue):pages.
```

### AMJ

## Word Count Tools

### For LaTeX files:
```bash
# Rough count (strips commands)
cat paper.tex | sed 's/\\[a-zA-Z]*{[^}]*}//g' | sed 's/\\[a-zA-Z]*//g' | wc -w

# More accurate: use texcount
texcount paper.tex
```

### For Word files:
- Use built-in word count (Review > Word Count)
- Exclude footnotes/endnotes if journal counts body only

### For Overleaf:
- Menu > Word Count (provides detailed breakdown)
