# ASQ Qualitative Paper Naming Strategies (1995-2024)

A typology of approaches for naming phenomena in qualitative/inductive/ethnographic papers, based on analysis of Administrative Science Quarterly publications.

## The Naming Problem

Qualitative papers often need to name the phenomenon they've identified. This name appears in the title (after the colon), gets used throughout the paper, and ideally becomes how the field refers to the contribution. The challenge: balance catchiness (memorability, accessibility) with precision (accuracy, theoretical grounding).

## Typology of Naming Strategies

| **Category** | **Strategy** | **Examples** | **Catchiness** | **Precision** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Evocative Metaphor** | A vivid, unexpected image that captures the phenomenon | "Shadow Learning" (Beane 2019), "Time Famine" (Perlow 1999), "Invisible Cage" (Rahman 2021), "Golden Cage" (Michel 2011, SMJ) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Paradox/Oxymoron** | Juxtaposing contradictions | "Caring for the Caregivers" (Kahn 1993), "Contested Collaboration" (Kellogg 2009, AMJ) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Vernacular/Emic Term** | Using practitioners' own language | "Scut Work" (Huising 2015), "DNA Envy" (Bechky 2020) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Gerund + Noun Compound** | Active verb form creating new concept | "Sharing Meaning" (Bechky 2003), "Resourcing a Technological Portfolio" (Beane 2023), "Rebooting One's Professional Work" (Bourmault & Anteby 2023) | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **X and Y Structure** | Two concepts in tension | "Markets, Morals, and Practices of Trade" (Anteby 2010), "Latitude or Latent Control?" (Bechky & Chung 2018) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Precise Compound Noun** | Academic precision over catchiness | "Anchored Personalization" (DiBenigno 2017), "Subordinate Activation Tactics" (Kellogg 2019), "Status-Authority Asymmetry" (Karunakaran 2021) | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Question Format** | Provocative question in title | "How Can You Do It?" (Ashforth & Kreiner 1999, AMR) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Process Label** | Naming a dynamic process | "Disrupted Routines" (Edmondson et al. 2001), "Order from Chaos" (Massa & O'Mahony 2021) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Key Considerations

### 1. Double Meanings
The best names often work on multiple levels:
- "Shadow Learning" = learning in the shadows (hidden) + shadow as in shadowing experts
- "Contingent Development" = contingency theory mechanism + development is contingent/conditional
- "Time Famine" = scarcity framing applied to time

### 2. Scope of Outcomes
Ensure the name captures all key outcomes, not just one:
- If your paper shows both skill development AND career advancement, "skill window" is too narrow
- "Development" or "developmental" captures both

### 3. Evocative vs. Generic
Some metaphors are powerful but may feel generic:
- "Window" is clear and visual but common
- "Famine" is specific and memorable
- "Cage" implies entrapment vividly

### 4. Theoretical Anchoring
Consider whether the name should reference the theoretical mechanism:
- "Uncertainty's Dividend" ties directly to contingency theory
- "Borrowed Time" is evocative but doesn't signal the theory
- "Developmental Uncertainty" directly connects phenomenon to mechanism

### 5. Accessibility vs. Precision Trade-off
- More catchy → broader audience, higher citation potential, risk of imprecision
- More precise → clearer contribution, easier for theory building, may be forgettable

## The Full Title Structure

Most ASQ qualitative papers use: **[Catchy Name]: [Descriptive Subtitle]**

The subtitle does the precision work, allowing the main name to be evocative:
- "Shadow Learning: Building Robotic Surgical Skill When Approved Means Fail"
- "The Time Famine: Toward a Sociology of Work Time"
- "The Invisible Cage: Workers' Reactivity to Opaque Algorithmic Evaluations"

This structure lets you have both: catchiness in the name, precision in the subtitle.

## Process for Developing Names

1. **List all key outcomes** (skill, career, mobility, etc.)
2. **Identify the core mechanism** (uncertainty, coordination, timing, etc.)
3. **Generate 10-15 options** across multiple typology categories
4. **Test for double meanings** that add richness
5. **Check scope** — does it capture all outcomes?
6. **Draft subtitles** for top candidates
7. **Get feedback** on memorability and precision
