## Option 1 (velocity + results focus)

Tested this. 5 days, part-time. Two datasets that had been sitting dormant for 2-3 years.

Result: 3 papers, 13 frame shifts, journal-ready drafts.

The key insight isn't faster regressions—it's the full paper development pipeline. Especially powerful if you have mixed-methods data.

## Option 2 (more specific about the work)

@aniketapanjwani Tested this with real dormant research data.

5 days (part-time):
• 2 datasets, untouched for 2-3 years
• 127K observations + 77 interviews
• 3 papers through 13 frame shifts
• Journal-formatted, adversarially reviewed

It's not about faster graphs. It's about the full data-to-paper pipeline.

## Option 3 (emphasizing what wouldn't have happened)

This work wouldn't have happened otherwise. I had the data for years. The pipeline from "exploratory analysis" to "submittable paper" was too daunting.

5 days later: 3 papers, each through 3-5 complete reframings.

AI doesn't replace expertise—it lets you actually use it.

## Option 4 (shortest, punchiest)

Tested this.

5 days. 3 papers. 13 frame shifts. From data I'd had sitting dormant for years.

The insight: it's not about faster regressions. It's about collapsing the full data-to-paper pipeline—especially with mixed-methods data.

Writing up the recipe.

## Recommendation

Option 4 is the punchiest. But Option 3 captures something important: this work *wouldn't have happened* without the tool. That's the real story—not that it was faster, but that it happened at all.

Consider combining:

**Final version:**

> Tested this. 5 days, part-time. 3 papers from data I'd had sitting dormant for 2-3 years.
>
> 13 complete frame shifts. Journal-ready. Each reviewed by a second AI as adversarial pre-reviewer.
>
> The real story: this work wouldn't have happened otherwise. The pipeline was too daunting.
